YouTube Shuffle
---

This is a javascript application for listening to music on YouTube. The idea is that you amass a collection of songs you like, and YouTube Shuffle plays them at random. YouTube playlists are complicated and the user interface is complicated and bad. When you hear a song you like, just paste its URL into YouTube Shuffle.

There is no server required to host this page -- it can be downloaded and run locally. The playlist is passively saved in HTML5 local storage, but can also be batch imported/exported for easy sharing (e.g. using [pastebin](http://www.pastebin.com)) with other people or across devices.
